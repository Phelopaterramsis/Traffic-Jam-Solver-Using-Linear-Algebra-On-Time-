# Traffic-Jam-Solver-Using-Linear-Algebra-On-Time-
This folder contains my MATH 201 Linear Algebra project, where I applied Gaussian elimination and augmented matrices to model and solve urban traffic congestion. The project also includes a simple Python GUI prototype that recommends the least-traffic road using real-time flow inputs.
